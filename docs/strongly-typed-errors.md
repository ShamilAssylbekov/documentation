## Bad Cancel Timer Attributes

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed while attempting to cancel a Timer.

Check your Timer attributes for a missing Timer Id value, and retry the Event.

## Bad Cancel Workflow Execution Attributes

The Workflow Task failed due to an unset CancelWorkflowExecution attribute.

## Bad Complete Workflow Execution Attributes

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed due to unset attributes on CompleteWorkflowExecution.

## Bad Continue as New Attributes

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed to validate on a `ContinueAsNew attribute.
The attribute could also be unset.

## Bad Fail Workflow Execution Attributes

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed due to unset FailWorkflowExecution attributes.

If you encounter this error, make sure that `StartToClostTimeout` or `ScheduleToCloseTimeout` are set.
Restart the Worker that the Workflow and Activity are registered to.

## Bad Modify Workflow Properties Attributes

This error indicastes that the Workflow Task failed to validate attributes on a property in the Upsert Memo.

## Bad Record Marker Attributes

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed due to an unset or incorrect Marker name.

## Bad Request Cancel Activity Attributes

An invalid history builder state is preventing the Activity from canceling.

If needed, update the Temporal SDK.
Review your Workflow logic for nondeterministic code.

## Bad Request Cancel External Workflow Execution

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed while trying to cancel an external Workflow, either from invalid or unset event attributes.

## Bad Schedule Activity Attributes

This error indicates that there are missing or incorrect ScheduleActivity attributes.

If you encounter this error, make sure that `StartToClostTimeout` or `ScheduleToCloseTimeout` are set.
Restart the Worker that the Workflow and Activity are registered to.

## Bad Search Attributes

This error indicates that the Workflow Task is either missing or exceeding a set limit.
This can cause Workflow Tasks to continue to retry without success.

## Bad Signal Input Size

This error indicates that the Payload has exceeded the Signal's available input size.

## Bad Signal Workflow Execution Attributes

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed to validate attributes for `SignalWorkflowExecution`.

## Bad Start Child Execution Attributes

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed to validate attributes for `StartChildWorkflowExecution`.

## Bad Start Timer Attributes

This error indicates that the scheduled Event is missing a Timer Id.

Set a valid Timer Id and retry the Event.

## Cause Bad Binary

This error indicates that the Worker deployment was marked as bad binary.
Therefore, the system must fail the Workflow Task.

## Cause Reset Workflow

This error indicates that the Workflow Task failed due to a request to reset the Workflow.

## Cause Unspecified

This error indicates that the Workflow Task has failed for an unknown reason.

If you see this error, file a bug report here.

## Failover Close Command

This error indicates that a Namespace failover forced the Workflow Task to close.

## Force Close Command

This error indicates that the Workflow Task was forced to close.
A retry will be scheduled if the error is recoverable.

## Non-Deterministic Error

The Workflow Task failed due to a nondeterministic error.

## Pending Activities Limit Exceeded

The Workflow has reached the maximum number of pending Activities.
The Workflow Task was failed to prevent the creation of more Activities.

## Pending Child Workflows Limit Exceeded

This error indicates that the maximum number of Child Workflows has been reached.
The Workflow Task was failed to prevent any more Child Workflows from being added.

## Pending Request Cancel Limit Exceeded

The capacity for pending `CancelWorkflow` requests has been reached.

## Pending Signals Limit Exceeded

The capacity for pending Signals to be sent from this Workflow has been reached.

## Reset Sticky Task Queue

This error indicates that the Sticky Task Queue needs to be reset.

If you see this error, reset the Sticky Task Queue.
The system will retry automatically.

## Resource Exhausted Cause Concurrent Limit

This error indicates that the concurrent poller count has been reached.

## Resource Exhausted Cause Persistence Limit

This error indicates that the persistence rate limit has been reached.

## Resource Exhausted Cause RPS Limit

This error indicates that the Workflow has reached its RPS limit.

## Resource Exhausted Cause System Overload

This error indicates that the system is overloaded and cannot allocate further resources to Workflow Tasks.

## Resource Exhausted Cause Unspecified

This error indicates that an unknown cause is preventing resources from being allocated to further Workflow Tasks.

## Schedule Activity Duplicate Id

This error indicates that the Activity Id is already in use.

## Start Timer Duplicate Id

This error indicates that a Timer with the given Timer Id has already started.
Therefore, the Workflow Task failed.

## Unhandled Command

This error indicates new available Events since the last Workflow Task started.
A RetryWorkflow Task has been scheduled to handle these new Events.

`UnhandledCommand` usually happens when the Workflow is receiving a high number of Signals.
If the Workflow doesn't have enough time to handle these Signals, the Workflow Task will fail and try to call the previous Event again.

To prevent this error, drain the Signal Channel with the ReceiveAsync function.

## Workflow Worker Unhandled Failure

This error indicates that the Workflow Task encountered an unhandled failure from the Workflow Definition.
