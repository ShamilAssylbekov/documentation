Failure handling is an essential part of development. For more information, including the difference between application-level and platform-level failures, see [Handling Failure From First Principles](https://dominik-tornow.medium.com/handling-failures-from-first-principles-1ed976b1b869). For the practical application of those concepts in Temporal, see [Failure Handling in Practice](https://temporal.io/blog/failure-handling-in-practice).

Temporal Failures are representations (in the SDKs and Event History) of various types of errors that occur in the system.
